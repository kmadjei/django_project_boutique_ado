## Deployment

The E-commerce FullStack Django project has been deployed to ðŸ‘‰[Heroku.](https://kmadjei-boutique-ado.herokuapp.com/)ðŸ‘ˆ

### Deploying To Heroku

1. In order to deploy to heroku, a Github repository was created for the project.
2. Make sure to have downloaded [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash)
3. Go to the root folder directory of the app on the local computer.
4. Right click it and select **Git Bash here** to open the CLI terminal.
5. Initialize the project directory by typing ```git init``` in the terminal and pressing the Enter key.
6. Copy the url of the Github repository created for the app.
7. On the terminal, add the url you copied, as a remote with the command 
    ```git remote add origin <paste your github URL here> ```
    1. Make sure to also install **gunicorn** with ```pip install gunicorn``` in the terminal, inorder to deploy to heroku
8. Next, commit all your changes to git with these commands
    ```bash
    git add . 
    git commit -m "Your message here. Example <First commit>"
    ```
9. Create the main branch of your repository with the command ```git branch -M main```
10.  After the steps above,  the project can now be pushed to the repository with the command ```git push```
11. Now the project is ready to be deployed to Heroku.
12. Before deploying our Python App to Heroku, 2 files will need to be created. **Procfile and Requirements.txt**
    1. In the gitbash terminal of the root folder directory of the project. Run these commands to create the procfile and requirements.txt. Note: Make sure you have downloaded and added python to your environment variables.
    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    touch Procfile
    ```
    2. Make sure the Procfile created has a capital "P" in the title. Open the Procfile in a text editor and add this line of text on the first line ```web: gunicorn boutique_ado.wsgi:application```. Note: make sure there is not extra line after the first one. Not even an empty line.
    3. Repeat step 8 and 10 of the steps above.
13. After creating an account on Heroku, an app name where the project is hosted will need to be created from the dash board.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/heroku-new.PNG?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

14. Select the app created.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/appname.PNG?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

15. Click on the settings tab and then click the **Reveal Config Vars** to add the config variables of the python application.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/settings.PNG?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

16. The following are the config vars to be added. Note: Some were given upon integrating functionalities such as stripe intents and webhooks.
    1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    3. DATABASE_URL
    4. EMAIL_HOST_PASS
    5. EMAIL_HOST_USER
    6. SECRET_KEY --> for django
    7. STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
    8. STRIPE_WH_SECRET
    9. STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
    10. USE_AWS = True
17. Once the config vars are added, navigate to the **Deploy** tab.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/deploytab.png?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

18. In the diployment section, select Github for the deployment method and connect to the github repository for the project by searching for its name.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/deploy.png?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

19. Further down the page you will have to select the automatic deployment and for the manual deploy section, choose main branch and click the ```Deploy Branch``` button.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/viewlive.png?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

20. The above steps will cause Heroku to process the project files and create a link for you to view the live deployment of the Flask Web Application Project.
